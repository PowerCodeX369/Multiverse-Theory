## 📖 Abstract
This theory proposes a bold cosmological model in which each universe within the multiverse exerts gravitational influence on others. Contrary to the conventional idea that our universe is expanding due to internal dark energy, this theory suggests it is being *pulled outward* due to gravitational attraction from neighboring universes. Over time, this interaction leads to convergence, collision, and unification — a fusion of all universes into a single, conscious whole.

## 🔍 Core Concepts

### 🌀 Multiversal Gravity
- Universes have mass-energy and exert gravitational pull across higher dimensions.
- These pulls create movement and eventual convergence between universes.

### 🌌 Illusion of Expansion
- What we observe as expansion is possibly an internal illusion caused by external convergence.

### 🌍 Convergence, Not Chaos
- Universe collisions result in unification and formation of hybrid universes.

### 🧬 Consciousness as Driver
- Consciousness may increase *because of* or *lead to* universal fusion.
- Final convergence could birth a single, omniconscious entity — the Omega Universe.

## 🧪 Hypotheses for Exploration
1. Gravitational leakage across universes (measurable anomalies)
2. Shifts in physical constants over cosmic time
3. Quantum correlation between complexity and conscious emergence
